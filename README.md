# WWDC20 Badge Creator
## ðŸ‘€ Overview
###  Submission Status: Accepted!
Hello, and thank you for your interest in my project! This is my accepted playground project I built for the WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge. Create your very own customized badge for the WWDC20 conference!
### Why Create This Playground?
WWDC20 is the first-ever all online Apple Event - and of course, the WWDC! This means all attendance to WWDC20 was online, so nobody had a conference badge. Conference badges, in my opinion, are objects with great sentimental value. They can remind you of the amazing time you had and the people you met. In my opinion, WWDC20 was even more special than other years, and it well deserves to have a badge.
## ðŸ’» Usage and Release Notes
Download this repository and open the `.playgroundbook` project with the [latest version of the Swift Playgrounds app for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/swift-playgrounds/id1496833156?mt=12).
This is not the exact playground I sent to Apple in 2020. This is version 1.1, containing minor updates for UI optimization to keep it running on the latest version of the Swift Playgrounds app. It also includes some updates regarding the WWDC20 countdown. All of these updates are indicated with line comments in the source code, and the minor updates don't affect the overall design of my project.
